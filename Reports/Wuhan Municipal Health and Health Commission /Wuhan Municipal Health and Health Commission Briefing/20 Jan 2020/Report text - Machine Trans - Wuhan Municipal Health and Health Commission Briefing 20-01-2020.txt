 Winter and spring are the seasons with high incidence of respiratory infectious diseases, as well as the period with high incidence of viral pneumonia. Experts advise that citizens should pay attention to cold protection, indoor ventilation and personal hygiene, strengthen physical exercise, maintain a light diet, and avoid activities in crowded places. Wear a face mask or cover your mouth and nose with tissues or clothing when you have a cough or sneeze to reduce the spread of germs. Pay close attention to symptoms such as fever and cough. Seek immediate medical attention when such symptoms occur.
